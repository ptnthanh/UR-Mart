# UR-Mart

urmart.herokuapp.com

We plan to build an online shopping application called UR Mart, similar to Amazon or
eBay. Our target audience are independent online merchants who sell products
alongside customers who seek products unavailable on more popular sites.
Our application will include these features listed below: <br>
● Using Flask as our web framework.<br>
● Deployed on Heroku.<br>
● Product database with vital data (e.g. SKU, Brand Name, Origin, etc,...).<br>
● User Authentication for sellers.<br>
● Sellers can use CRUD functions on products (e.g. create new products, delete
existing ones,...).<br>
● Buyers can add items to cart and check out (no REAL payment charged).<br>
